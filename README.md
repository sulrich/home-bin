# overview

scripts and tools i carry around with me.  these should be largely platform independent, but there may be employer or personal host specific scripts which need to be symlinked from various locations.  these are included in the local `.gitignore` file. 

# symlinked scripts not tracked here

- `ag.sh` - attachment grabber script for getting files associated with a case and sticking them on the local file system for review
- weekly-log.sh - this is a personal thang
- botpower.py - linked to the repo on the host it's appropriate to be on.
